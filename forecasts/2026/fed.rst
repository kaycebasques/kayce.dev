2026 Fed Forecasts
==================

My 2026 forecasts (and bets) related to the `Fed`_.

------
Thesis
------

The US economy will do fine this year. There will not be a big deflationary
crisis that forces the Fed to resurrect the 2020 playbook. Nor will there be a
big inflationary crisis like 2022. It will be a continuation of 2025.
Something is wrong with the labor market, but it's not obviously broken.
Likewise, inflation is still stubbornly higher than where the Fed wants it.
Policies that are good for employment are bad for inflation, and vice versa. I
think the Fed fears inflation more than unemployment.

The White House's attack on the Fed's independence will backfire, big time.
The Fed is now going to wait longer to cut the `Federal Funds Rate`_ (FFR),
and they're going to do less cuts overall. I think Powell is going to take the
unprecedented action of not leaving 

------------------
Federal Funds Rate
------------------

FFR will end the year at 2.75-3.0 (3 cuts) or 3.0-3.25 (2 cuts). This is the
sweet spot for giving the labor market some support, while also making sure that
inflation stays in check.

My initial forecast for `What will be the midpoint of the US federal funds
target range at the end of 2026?`_:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Answer", "Probability"

   "Less than 2.25%", "5%"
   "At least 2.25%, but less than 2.75%", "0%"
   "At least 2.75%, but less than 3.25%", "75%"
   "At least 3.25%, but less than 3.75%", "10%"
   "3.75% or more", "10%"

Less than 2.25% is possible in the event of a panic like 2008 or 2020.
2.25-2.75% is a nonsensical range to me.
