Fed Forecasts
=============

In January 2026 I placed a bunch of bets on `Kalshi`_ related to the `Fed`_.

------
Thesis
------

The US economy will do fine this year. There will not be a big crisis that forces the Fed to resurrect the 2020 playbook. That means that the Fed will have to continue walking the tightrope between unemployment and inflation. They both continue to be real risks. I think that the Fed fears inflation more than unemployment. When deciding between one policy that A) reduces inflation but increases employment, and another policy that B) increases inflation but reduces employment, the Fed will choose A. That means we're only getting 2 cuts to the FFR this year. The labor market is obviously weak, so they can't do 0 cuts. A single cut seems very unlikely, psychologically. 2 cuts is the sweet spot. 3 is also possible if the labor market looks really bad. I think all the cuts will be 25 bps; none of the unusual 50 bps or 75 bps moves that we saw in 2022 and 2023. Crowd consensus is that the cuts will start in June. My non-consensus call is that they'll start in April. We absolutely are not getting a cut in January. Powell already signaled that. Add to the fact Depending on whether there's 2 or 3 cuts, and also the start month, the cuts are most likely to happen during the April, June, July, and September FOMC sessions. In the October and December sessions they'll go into "wait and see" mode. TODO Fed indepence 

Big Tech will struggle, which will be a headwind for ^SPX at large, but other sectors will be healthy, maybe even thriving. I.e. the underperformance of Big Tech will be counterbalanced by the outperformance of other sectors.
